# Monty Hall Paradox 

Monty Hall Paradox is a simulation game based on the famous probability problem "The Monty Hall Problem". This app teaches the probability problem by getting experience from playing.

## Game Play Instructions:
The Monty Hall problem is a counter-intuitive statistics puzzle:
<br>•There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car.
<br>•You pick a door (call it door 1). You’re hoping for the car of course.
<br>Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (2 & 3) and always opens one of them with a goat (Both doors might have goats; he’ll randomly pick one to open)

<br>Here’s the game: Do you stick with door 1 (original guess) or switch to the other unopened door? Does it matter? Surprisingly, the odds aren’t 50-50. <br>If you switch doors, you’ll win 2/3 times!

<br>Today let’s get an intuition for why a simple game could be so baffling. The game is really about re-evaluating your decisions as new information emerges.
