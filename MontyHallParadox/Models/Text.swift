I have hidden a car behind one of these three doors. Behind the other two doors there are goats. If you choose the door with the car, you win the car! If you choose a door with a goat, you get a goat. Click on a door to choose it. I will display one goat and allow to stay with your choice or switch doors. Click on your door to stay with it, or click on the other door to switch. I will then reveal the location of the car. Click on any door to restart the game. Should you stay with your first choice, or switch?
